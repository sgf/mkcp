# mkcp
kcp implementation in C#.net core
<br>

I don't have much network programming foundation and don't understand UDP protocol. <br>
This project is just an **experimental project**.<br>
I even read the code of other similar projects to understand the principle and structure of Kcp. <br>
I have not yet fully grasped the design of Kcp.<br>

Therefore, **if used in a production environment, please use other Kcp warehouses**.
